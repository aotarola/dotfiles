dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles reposotory. Not super fancy but full of lazyness power.

The main purpose of this repository is to teach myself not to hard-code stuff in multiple boxes ðŸ¤·,
but feel free to use it or extract stuff from it ðŸ˜‰.

## install

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/aotarola/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```
