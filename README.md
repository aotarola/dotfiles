dotfiles
========

My personal `dotfiles` repository. Not super fancy but full of laziness power.

The main purpose of this repository is to teach myself not to hard-code stuff in multiple boxes ðŸ¤·,
but feel free to use it or extract stuff from it ðŸ˜‰.

## install

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/aotarola/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

## First time setup

My `dotfiles` are optimized to be used with different external dependencies, such as plug-in managers, theme managers, etc.

## `tmux`

* https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm (`tmux` plug-in manager)
* https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-pain-control (better pane control)
